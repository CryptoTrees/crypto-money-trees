Money doesn't grow on trees... or does it?

1. Create the buy and sell functionality
2. Make the trees grow. You have to give them watter regulary for optimum growth
3. The fruits give you real ether which is taken from the treasury. You get a random chance. The rarer the fruit, the more ether
4. When you buy a tree a 10% of the profit goes to the treasury
5. When you sell a tree 10% goes to the treasury
6. The bigger the tree, the more ether it generates
7. You have to claim your ether when you get fruits
8. Trees are being generated every hour at a fixed price of 1 ether which goes 50% developers and 50% treasury
